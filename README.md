# Dev Help Wanted

## Objective
Developers of this project have been short on time and have not been able to finish the functions defined in `main.py`.  
Lucky for you they have created function docstrings and unit test (`test_odds.py` and `test_vowels.py`) to make sure you implement them correctly.  
Make a **fork** of this repository, implement the functions, make a **pull request** back to this repo, and then **actions** will automatically run on your code to check if it is correct.  
Once all test success, **actions** for your **pull request** will contain a url for your flag (this url is only valid once and for 5 minutes within it being generated; actions can be re-run to get new url if needed).
